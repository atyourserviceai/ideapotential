### Assessment Flow via Agent Conversation

**Agent-Driven Intake Questions (Embedded in System Prompt)**

1. **Problem Clarity** → Agent asks: Problem description, JTBD formulation
2. **Outcome Gap** → Agent asks: User satisfaction, importance ratings
3. **Solution Evidence** → Agent asks: Demo links, unit economics
4. **Founder-Solution Fit** → Agent asks: Experience, passion scores
5. **Team-Scope Fit** → Agent asks: Team size, roadmap scope
6. **Competitive Moat** → Agent asks: Hamilton's 7 Powers assessment
7. **Market Pain Mentions** → Agent uses Composio tools: Reddit/Twitter scraping
8. **Early Demand** → Agent asks: Waitlist, pre-orders
9. **Traffic Authority** → Agent uses Composio tools: SEO domain analysis
10. **Marketing-Product Fit** → Agent asks: CAC/LTV metrics

**Agent continuously updates AppAgentState with collected evidence and calculates scores based on prompt instructions. Data automatically persists via existing Durable Object storage.**

## Success Metrics

- **MVP Validation**: 50 completed assessments within 2 weeks
- **User Engagement**: >50% completion rate for started assessments
- **Viral Growth**: >25% of users trigger sharing features
- **Data Quality**: >80% of factors have evidence strength ≥2

## Risk Mitigation

- **API Dependencies**: Fallback to manual input if external APIs fail
- **LLM Costs**: Implement credit limits and user-provided keys
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for founder data storage
- **Performance**: Optimize for mobile and slow connections

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**✅ COMPLETED (Phase 1):**
- Complete data model with types and Zod validation
